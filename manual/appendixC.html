	<h1>Appendix C, Version History and Changelog</h1>
		
		<a name="intro"></a><h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
		This is a comprehensive list of changes that have occurred between release version
		of <b>Swarm</b>.  The motivation for this list is partly curiousity and partly for 
		debugging.  If a bug crops up between versions it is almost certainly a result
		of one of the changes listed here.
		</p>
