		<h1>Section II, Data Sources and Channels</h1>
		
		<a name="ui"></a><h2>User Interface</h2>
		<img src="images/secII_1.png" align="left" hspace="15px">
			<p>
			After starting <b>Swarm</b> you will see a panel similar to this on the
			left side of the <b>Swarm</b> screen.  This is the Data Source Chooser
			and Channel Selector.  You can adjust the size of the two panels
			by adjusting the split line in the center, either by dragging with
			your mouse or clicking on one of the small arrows.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Data Source Chooser</h3>
			<p>
			The Data Source Chooser, the top half of the panel, is used to select the source of the waveform
			or helicorder data.  The box contains the list of all available data
			sources, both ones you have used before and new ones that you create.
			To choose a data source, select it and press the 'Go' button, or simply
			double-click on the data source.  To create new data source, press
			the 'New' button; read below for explanations of the different data
			sources.  You can also edit an existing data source be clicking
			on the 'Edit' button.  Finally, if there is a data source you no longer need you
			can remove it with the 'Remove' button.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Channel Selector</h3>
			<p>
			The Channel Selector, the bottom half of the panel, is used to select
			a channel, either the waveform or the helicorder.  Once you have selected
			a data source the Channel Selector will be populated with the available
			channels.  The contents of both the Waves and Helicorders lists depends
			on the data available from the selected data source.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Each of the channels lists is shown in a tree view.  All of the channels
			are displayed under the 'All' folder.  Double-click on a the 'All'
			folder for a complete list of stations.  Often it is convenient
			to groups stations by a common theme or geographical location (in
			the image above the channels are grouped by volcano).  See the
			<a href="sectionIII.html">Advanced Topics</a> section for how to
			set up these channel groupings.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			If the Waves tab is selected in the Channel Selector then a wave can
			be opened into one of two places: a <a href="sectionV.html">real-time wave viewer</a>
			frame or onto the <a href="sectionVI.html">Wave Clipboard</a>.  Select the appropriate button to open
			the wave accordingly.  Also, double-clicking on a channel will open
			it into a real-time wave viewer frame.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			If the Helicorders tab is selected that you can open a helicorder by
			double-clicking on a channel or clicking the View Helicorder button.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			You can also open more than one channel at a time.  Simply select multiple
			channels (with Control- or Shift-click on Windows) or an entire folder
			in the Channel Selector then press the appropriate button (Realtime, Clipboard, or
			View Helicorder).
			</p>
			
			<a name="data"></a><h2>Data Sources</h2>
			<p>
			<b>Swarm</b> can currently get data from a few different places, 
			described below.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Earthworm Wave Servers</h3>
			<p>
			To connect to an Earthworm Wave Server (technically, the wave_serverV module of the
			USGS Earthworm system) you need to create a new data source.  Click
			on the New button on the Data Source Chooser.  A window similar to
			the one below will appear.
			</p>
			
			<p><img src="images/secII_2.png"></p>
			
			<p>
			You need to specify a unique name for the data source (which is then 
			displayed in the Data Source Chooser), the Wave Server host name
			or IP address, and the port number. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
			An Earthworm Wave Server data source will populate both the Waves
			and Helicorder lists of the Channel Selector.  Some clarification
			about how this works is in order.  An Earthworm Wave Server actually
			only provides raw wave data, not derived helicorder data.  When you
			choose a helicorder view based on Earthworm Wave Server data, 
			<b>Swarm</b> starts a process called a <i>Gulper</i> that slowly downloads
			data to fill in the requested helicorder time interval.  This process
			will take several minutes.  One positive side effect of this process
			is that the raw wave data will be immediately available for viewing
			and analysis from the <b>Swarm</b> cache.  
			</p>
			
			<h3>Winston Servers</h3>
			<p>
			Winston Servers are another
			data source for <b>Swarm</b>.  Winston Servers store both derived
			helicorder data and raw wave data.  Winston is still under heavy
			development at the Alaska Volcano Observatory so is not available
			to non-AVO users at this time.
