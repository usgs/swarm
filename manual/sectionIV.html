		<h1>Section IV, Helicorder Views</h1>
		
		<a name="ui"></a><h2>User Interface</h2>
		<p>
		<b>Swarm</b> is also a tool for interacting with and displaying helicorders.  Here is a typical helicorder view (actually,
		this is smaller size than typical in order to fit into the manual better):<br><br>
		<img src="images/secIV_1.png">
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The view consists of a window displaying the data source '[Winston]' and the channel 'CRP_SHZ_AK'.  In the window is the helicorder, 
		bordered on the top by a toolbar and on the bottom by a status bar that shows the time under the mouse cursor.
		The spectrogram inside the helicorder was generated when the user clicked on the helicorder.  A small transparent yellow 
		box under the inset wave view shows the area that is being magnified.
		<p>
		
		<p>
		Helicorders derived from an active source, like a Wave Server or Winston connection, will automatically update themselves when new
		data are available.
		</p>
		
		<a name="settings"></a><h2>Helicorder View Settings Dialog</h2>
		<p>
		There are two main ways in which you can interact with the a helicorder view: manipulating the helicorder view itself or zooming
		in and looking at the underlying waveform.  All of the settings for the helicorder view can be manipulated in the helicorder
		view settings dialog which can be opened by clicking on this button: <img src="../images/settings.png">.  The settings dialog
		box looks like this:<br><br>
		<img src="images/secIV_2.png">
		</p>
		
		<a name="axes"></a><h3>Axes Options</h3>
		<p>These settings effect the size of the X and Y axes.  The X axis determines the number of minutes to display along the bottom.
		Legal values are 10, 15, 20, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 360.  Values above 60 are seldom used.  The Y axis determines how much total 
		time to display on the helicorder and is measured in hours.  Legal values are 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 168.  The default settings
		generate a 12 hour helicorder with 15 minutes rows.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The last settings under Axes is 'View time'.  This setting allows you to set the time at the bottom of the helicorder.  By default
		a helicorder view opens with the bottom being set to 'Now'.  The format for specifying the bottom view time is "YYYYMMDD" or, if more
		resolution is needed, "YYMMDDHHMMSS".
		</p>
		
		<a name="zoom"></a><h3>Zoom Options</h3>
		<p>
		The zoom settings allow you to customize the display of the zoomed waveform view.  The first setting, 'Zoom' determines the amount of time
		<i>on either side of the mouse cursor</i> to zoom.  Also available is a button to display the <a href="sectionIII.html#settings">Wave
		View Settings Dialog</a>.
		</p>
		
		<a name="other"></a><h3>Other Options</h3>
		<p>
		These settings configure various other options for the helicorder view.  'Refresh' is the number of seconds between attempts to refresh
		the helicorder with the latest data, the default value is 15.  'Scroll size' is the number of helicorder rows to scroll up or down on user's 
		scroll requests with the mouse-wheel or the scroll toolbar buttons.  The next option 'Force Center' forces each helicorder sample to be centered
		on its current line.  This effectively eliminates all drift and is useful for broadband stations with lots of 
		low frequency energy.  Use this feature with caution though: it can make an obviously false signal look like an earthquake.  'Auto-scale'
		toggles helicorder auto-scaling on and off.  When auto-scaling is on an attempt is made to produce a "pleasant" looking helicorder.  If this 
		fails, or if you want more control over the appearance of the helicorder, set the 'One bar range'.  The 'One bar range' is the number of counts
		on either side of zero that make up one bar.  For example, if you have a seismometer that reports counts between -3600 and 3600 and you select 
		a bar range of 1200, a full-range waveform will take 3 bars, overlapping one above and one below.  This is best understood through experimentation.
		The last options are 'Show clip' and 'Clip threshold'.  This allows you to set a counts threshold after which the trace will be shown in red.

		<a name="toolbar"></a><h2>Toolbar and Keyboard Interaction</h2>
		<p>There is toolbar full of buttons at the top of each helicorder.  Here is a description of each button:<br>
		<br>
		<img src="../images/minimize.png"> - Minimizes the toolbar, maximizing screen real-estate for the helicorder.<br>
		<img src="../images/settings.png"> - Opens the settings dialog.<br>

		<br>
		Also, when an inset wave view is open the <a href="sectionIII.html#keys">standard keys for interacting with wave views</a> are active.<br>
